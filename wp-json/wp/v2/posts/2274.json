When mobile users try to access websites that are not mobile responsive, it\u2019s a truly frustrating experience. Most of these searchers move on to your competitors\u2019 websites and never return to yours. So as you can guess, these are lost leads. But now, there\u2019s another crucial reason to mobilize your website; Google is making some changes that will negatively impact any website that is not mobile-ready.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is changing?<\/strong><br \/>\nMobile-friendliness has been a factor in Google search for several years now, but no one knows exactly to what degree. However, Google has announced that mobile-friendliness will now be heavily weighed as a ranking signal. On February 26, 2015, Google wrote this statement on their Webmaster Tools blog: \u00ecThis change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact on our search results. A Google mobile algorithm update will start on April 21, 2015, and will roll out over a period of a few days to one week \u2013 influencing the organic results for web searches performed on mobile devices. The search industry has labeled this update as Mobilegeddon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why the change?<\/strong><br \/>\nMore than 60 percent of all Google searches are now performed on mobile devices. So Google\u2019s overall goal with this update is to provide a faster, smoother experience for mobile searchers. When mobile users try to access websites that are not mobile-ready, it\u2019s pretty much a waste of time. In order to match mobile users with the most beneficial websites based on their searches, this algorithm update will ensure that mobile-friendly websites get the most search engine attention.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean for your business?<\/strong><br \/>\nBasically, if your site is not mobile-ready, it will suffer lower rankings on Google when users search for your type of products and services on their mobile devices. On the flip side, if your website is mobile-friendly, you may experience an increase in rankings; especially in cases where most of your competitors haven\u2019t optimized their websites for mobile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What should you do?<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Make sure your website is mobile-ready. This may sound like a no-brainer, but just because your website looks fine on a desktop or laptop does not mean that it is the same for mobile devices. Google has provided a free Mobile Friendliness tool where you can test your website for mobile. Here\u2019s the link:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-friendly\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-friendly<\/a>.\u00a0You can tell within a few minutes whether or not your site meets the basic standards for mobile optimization.<\/p>\n<p>2. If your website is not mobile-ready, it is time to change that. Whether you go with a complete mobile-responsive website re-design or a stand-alone mobile website, take measures as soon as possible to ensure your business is not negatively impacted by this major update.\u00a0Having a website that is optimized for mobile viewing is critical. Not only is it important for providing convenience to your mobile customers and prospects; it is now a major factor in how well these mobile consumers can find your website when searching online for your type of products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Contact the<a href=\"https:\/\/islandwebsolutions.com\/\">\u00a0Island Web Solutions<\/a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/islandwebsolutions.com\/\">Long Island Web Design<\/a>\u00a0experts today!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your company website is not mobile-ready, more than likely, you\u2019ve been missing out on potential customers.
