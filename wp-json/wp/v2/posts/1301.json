Yes, you\u2019ll want to write a caption for the images you choose, but people are seeing the visuals first.<\/p>\n<h3>Photos of your team, product, and services<\/h3>\n<p>Keep in mind framing, lighting, and angles. Make sure the images you share on Instagram are edited, well-cropped and high-quality.<\/p>\n<h3>Your events, giveaways, and specials<\/h3>\n<p>You can use these as opportunities to run contests on Instagram encouraging followers to tag their friends.<\/p>\n<h3>Video or Boomerang content<\/h3>\n<p>(Boomerang takes a burst of photos, speeds them up and plays them forward and backward to create a looping video). Take advantage of Instagram\u2019s features to switch up your posts.<\/p>\n<h3>In-the-moment content on Instagram Stories<\/h3>\n<p>Have something to share, but don\u2019t want to dedicate a post to it?
